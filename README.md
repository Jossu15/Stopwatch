# Stopwatch

A stopwatch program in C++ is likely to be a console-based or graphical user interface (GUI) application that simulates the functionality of a stopwatch. Here's a general overview of what such a program might include:

User Interface: The program may have a simple text-based or graphical interface that displays the current elapsed time, buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.

Start, Stop, and Reset: Users can start the stopwatch to initiate timing, stop it to freeze the elapsed time, and reset it to zero for a fresh measurement.

Display: The program likely updates the display in real-time as the stopwatch runs, showing minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Accuracy: The stopwatch should be designed to provide accurate timing, considering the limitations of the system's clock and timer resolution.
